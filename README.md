<h2>📊 India Unemployment Analysis & Interactive Dashboard</h2>

<h3>🌟 Overview</h3>

This project provides a comprehensive data-driven exploration of unemployment trends in India, with a specific focus on the economic shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing two distinct datasets, the project tracks the shift in labor dynamics across different states, macro-regions, and the Rural/Urban divide. It culminates in an interactive Streamlit Dashboard that allows users to visualize trends and simulate economic scenarios in real-time.

<h3>🚀 Key Features</h3>
<b>National Trend Analysis:</b> Visualizes the timeline of unemployment spikes with markers for major events like the March 2020 lockdown.

<b>State-to-State Comparison:</b> An interactive multi-select tool to compare the recovery trajectories of different Indian states side-by-side.

<b>Geospatial & Regional Hierarchy:</b> Uses Sunburst charts to drill down from macro-regions (North, South, etc.) into specific state-level data.

<b>Rural vs. Urban Insights:</b> Comparative box plots that reveal which sectors of the economy were more resilient during the crisis.

<b>Predictive 'What-If' Simulator:</b> A dynamic tool allowing users to simulate how changes in Labour Participation Rate might correlate with Unemployment levels.

<b>Temporal Filtering:</b> Global date sliders to focus on specific periods, from pre-pandemic stability to the height of the crisis.

<h3>🛠️ Tech Stack</h3>
Language: Python 3.12

Web Framework: Streamlit (for building the interactive dashboard)

Data Manipulation: Pandas (data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation)

Visualization: Plotly Express & Plotly Graph Objects (for interactive, high-fidelity charts)

Environment: PyEnv / VirtualEnv


🏁 How to Run
Clone the repository.

Install dependencies: pip install streamlit pandas plotly.

Run the app: streamlit run app.py.
<h3>📝 Final Words</h3>
 <h4>
This project goes beyond static data analysis by transforming raw CSV files into an actionable economic tool. It demonstrates the power of Python in handling real-world socio-economic data and provides a framework for policymakers and researchers to understand labor market vulnerabilities. Whether you are looking at the massive 2020 spike or regional disparities, this dashboard makes the data speak for itself.
